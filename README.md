# FinOPS_CostOptimization_Tools
This aims to identify a pluggable service that can be seamlessly integrated into our existing client infrastructure. The goal is to enable cost tracking, highlight opportunities for improved efficiency (such as scaling and usage optimizations), and provide actionable insights through a tool or a set of tools. By implementing this as part of proactive maintenance, we ensure continuous cost optimization and resource management.
